# restaurant_management_with_ai

# Abstract
 This project explores the development and implementation of an intelligent system for
 managing and monitoring a restaurant environment using advanced artificial intelligence
 techniques. The system integrates face recognition technology to track employee
 movements and a YOLO-based object detection model to classify various types of Pizzas.
 A comprehensive database design using MySQL ensures efficient storage and retrieval
 of data, while a user-friendly dashboard provides real-time insights and detailed statistics
 on the collected data.

For face detection, this project uses the face_recognition library from
https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition, and YOLOv5 from 'https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5'
is employed todetect different types of ingredients. To get started, you'll need
to download these models and install all required Python libraries.The file
"How to Run" includes the command lines necessary to execute
each model: YOLO, face recognition, or the dashboard.
